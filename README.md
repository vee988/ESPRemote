ESPRemote is a simple collision avoidance testing and remote telemetry robotic platform that integrates embedded systems with full-stack web technologies. The system is built around an ESP32 microcontroller using the Arduino framework, which manages L298N-driven DC motors for propulsion and a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor for dynamic obstacle detection. The mobile interface, developed using React Native, Expo and TypeScript , serves as a dual-purpose dashboard that functions as a direct WiFi remote controller by sending HTTP GET requests to the robot's web server to trigger movement states, while simultaneously acting as a data monitor. When the robot performs collision avoidance maneuvers—automatically halting when obstacles are detected within adjustable distances, it acts as an HTTP client to transmit the stopping distance telemetry to a J2EE backend . This backend, structured with Java Servlets and Hibernate ORM, persists the sensor data into a SQL database and exposes a JSON API, allowing the mobile app to retrieve and render a historical log of stopping distances via a FlashList interface.
